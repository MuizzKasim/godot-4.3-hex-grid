# Godot v4.3 hex grid
This project is my attempt at recreating Jasper Flick's (Catlike Coding) Hex Map tutorial for Godot v4.3 engine. <br/>
It follows CatLike Coding's tutorial up to Tutorial #4 Irregularity. <br/>
This project uses individual ArrayMesh instance to represent each hex tile. <br/>
While this approach may work for small scale hex grids, it is highly unoptimized for larger sized grids. <br/>

## Camera Control
While in play mode, hold RMB plus WASD to move around the camera and explore the hex grid.
